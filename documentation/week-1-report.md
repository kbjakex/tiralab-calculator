## Report for week 1

I have had a limited amount of time to work on this, and could only start on Friday. Up until then, I had decided to implement the 
[L1 pathfinding](https://mikolalysenko.github.io/l1-path-finder/www/) algorithm, port it to 3D and compare performance with Jump-Point Search.

on Friday, I spent some six hours writing a platform for the pathfinding - namely, a representation of the world, meshing and rendering.
Due to email discussions on Saturday, this ended up not being the project I'd go with, and much of Saturday has been spent discussing and thinking of the 
topic, amidst other weekend hassle.

I have spent some time staring at the Shunting-Yard algorithm, and that seems to now make sense. This made me increasingly nervous about the scope being too small,
though, which I brought up in an email.

No code has been produced for the new topic yet, as it was chosen quite late.

All in all, I would estimate that a total of 9 hours was sunk into this.

### Next steps

My next step will be writing the most basic REPL (read-eval-print-loop) interface and implementing the Shunting-Yard algorithm.

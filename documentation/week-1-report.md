## Report for week 1

I have had a limited amount of time to work on this, and could only start on Friday. Up until then, I had decided to implement the 
[L1 pathfinding](https://mikolalysenko.github.io/l1-path-finder/www/) algorithm, port it to 3D and compare performance with Jump-Point Search.

On Friday, I spent some six hours writing a platform for the pathfinding - namely, a representation of the world, meshing and rendering.
Due to email discussions on Saturday, this ended up not being the project I'd go with, and much of Saturday has been spent discussing and thinking of the 
topic, amidst other weekend hassle.

I have spent some time staring at the Shunting-Yard algorithm, and that seems to now mostly make sense. This made me increasingly nervous about the scope being too small, though, which I brought up in an email.

I laid down a fair amount of groundwork: a simple REPL interface (too barebones still), defined the abstract syntax tree, and got started on implementing the algorithm. The project does not work yet, however.

All in all, I would estimate that a total of 9 hours was sunk into this.

### Next steps

The implementation of the Shunting-Yard algorithm is by no means done yet, work on that will continue. My understanding of the algorithm is not good enough either, so I'll be spending more time on that.

## Report for week 5

This week I
* Got unary operators working as promised
* Implemented `^` (power) and `%` (remainder)
* Reimplemented syntax validation. Previous implementation had limitations that, for example, made parameterless functions (`f()`) impossible, and I kept
finding sneaky bugs in it.
* Did a whoole lot more testing and bugfixing! I changed the interface code a bit and wrote tests for it as well, which caught a number of bugs.
* Improved error messages. Implementation details finally no longer leak to the user, and error messages are more specific and helpful.
* Brought code coverage up as promised.
* Cleaned up the code a bit.

And of course wrote a peer review, which ended up taking a lot more time than anticipated.

Good progress this week. I unfortunately forgot my laptop's charger to the campus at Friday's LaMa session, and proceeded to head to Porvoo right after,
and did not think to prepare another device, so I've had to improvise. We had a 13 year iMac around that hasn't really been used in years, but turns out
it works for this just fine! Then mouse broke at the critical point an hour before deadline and I had to improvise some more...

And as I'm writing this, it is 11:49 PM, and I'm yet to figure out how to authenticate the Mac on GitHub so I can push!

Everything is clearly under control.

.. to be continued next week.

Time spent this week: 8 hours

### Next steps

The project is basically done at this point, barring the built-in functions & variables that I've been putting off, even though they take 5 minutes to 
add. So that'll definitely be in next week. I also have a series more tests in mind I could write, probably will (but just barely can't make it 
for this deadline), so that, as well.

Then, more importantly, I'll heavily consider switching to a big decimal library for all calculation, to make things a bit more scientific.

I'll also see if I get feedback, and work on whatever is pointed out there. It's now 11:44 PM and I have not received the peer review.
